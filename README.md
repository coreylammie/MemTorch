MemTorch is a _Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep Learning Systems_, which integrates directly with the well-known PyTorch Machine Learning (ML) library. MemTorch is formally described in _MemTorch: An Open-source Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep Learning Systems_, which is openly accessible [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10971).

## MemTorch: An Open-source Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep Learning Systems

> **Abstract:** _Memristive devices have shown great promise to facilitate the acceleration and improve the power efficiency of Deep Learning (DL) systems. Crossbar architectures constructed using these Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) devices can be used to efficiently implement various in-memory computing operations, such as Multiply Accumulate (MAC) and unrolled-convolutions, which are used extensively in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, memristive devices face concerns of aging and non-idealities, which limit the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of Memristive Deep Learning Systems (MDLSs), that should be considered prior to circuit-level realization. This Original Software Publication (OSP) presents MemTorch, an open-source framework for customized large-scale memristive DL simulations, with a refined focus on the co-simulation of device non-idealities. MemTorch also facilitates co-modelling of key crossbar peripheral circuitry. MemTorch adopts a modernized soft-ware engineering methodology and integrates directly with the well-known PyTorch Machine Learning (ML) library._

## Installation

MemTorch can be installed from source using `python setup.py install`:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/coreylammie/MemTorch
cd MemTorch
python setup.py install
```

or using `pip install .`, as follows:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/coreylammie/MemTorch
cd MemTorch
pip install .
```

_If CUDA is `True` in `setup.py`, CUDA Toolkit 10.1 and Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools are required. If `CUDA` is False in `setup.py`, Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools are required._

Alternatively, MemTorch can be installed using the _pip_ package-management system:

```
pip install memtorch-cpu # Supports normal operation
pip install memtorch # Supports CUDA and normal operation
```

## API & Example Usage

A complete API is avaliable [here](https://memtorch.readthedocs.io/). To learn how to use MemTorch, and to reproduce results of ‘_MemTorch: An Open-source Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep Learning Systems_’, we provide numerous tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks [here](https://memtorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html).

The best place to get started is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/coreylammie/MemTorch/blob/master/memtorch/examples/Tutorial.ipynb).
