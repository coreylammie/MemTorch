MemTorch
====================================
`MemTorch <https://github.com/coreylammie/MemTorch>`_ is a simulation framework for memristive deep learning systems that integrates directly with the well-known PyTorch Machine Learning (ML) library.
MemTorch is formally described in *MemTorch: An Open-source Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep Learning Systems*, which is openly accessible `here <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10971>`_.
