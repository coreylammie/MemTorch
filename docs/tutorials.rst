Tutorials
====================================

To learn how to use MemTorch, and to reproduce results of 'MemTorch: An Open-source Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep Learning Systems', we provide numerous Jupyter notebooks.

:doc:`Tutorial.ipynb <Tutorial>` details example usage of MemTorch to:

1. Train and benchmark a DNN model using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Convert a pretrained DNN to a Memristive-DNN (MDNN).
3. Patch a converted Memristive-CNN.
4. Introduce non-ideal device characteristics to a generic memristive model.

:doc:`CaseStudy.ipynb <CaseStudy>` can be used to reproduce the results from the case study presented in 'MemTorch: An Open-source Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep Learning Systems'.

:doc:`NovelSimulations.ipynb <NovelSimulations>` can be used to reproduce the results from the novel simulations presented in 'MemTorch: An Open-source Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep Learning Systems'.
